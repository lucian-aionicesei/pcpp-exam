# Lecture 12: Message Passing I

## Goals

The goals of this lecture are:

* Explain and reason about the Actor model of concurrent computation.
* Explain the differences between message passing and shared memory concurrency.
* Implement systems based on the Actor model using Erlang.

## Readings

* Gul A. Agha. [Actors: A Model Of Concurrent Computation In Distributed Systems](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a157917.pdf). MIT Press 1985:
  * Chapter 2, complete.
	* This book is a bit old, but this chapter provides a more objective comparison of shared memory and actors model (as opposed to the sections in the Akka documention mentioned above).
    
* Erlang official documentation (for version OTP 26) 
  * [Chapter 3 - Concurrent Programming](https://www.erlang.org/docs/26/getting_started/conc_prog)
