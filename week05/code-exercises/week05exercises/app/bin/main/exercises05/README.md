## Exercise 5.1

1. In our implementation, the class state is comprised by the array of atomic integers `counts`. We ensure that the class state does not escape:
	- By making the fields `private` such that the local fields are only available to the instance of a class;
	- By only accessing our fields for read/write, through the `increment`, `getCount`  and `getAndClear` methods, which does not return a reference to the private field, but return a copy of that.
	We ensure safe publication by making the class state immutable. If an objectâ€™s fields are marked as `final`, they are guaranteed to be fully initialised by the time the constructor finishes. Any thread that accesses the object after construction will see the correctly initialised `final` field values.

2. We change `counts` to be an array of `AtomicInteger` because of their inherited ability to provide lock-free read/write methods such as CAS. CAS can detect interference from other threads and atomically update the old value to the new value `0`. We also use the do-while loop, which checks for the old value and updates to the new value only if the older value hasn't been overwritten in the meanwhile. After the value has been updated successfully only then we return the old value. This way we ensure atomicity.
